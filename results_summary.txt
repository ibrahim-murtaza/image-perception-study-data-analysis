IMAGE PERCEPTION STUDY - RESULTS SUMMARY
================================================================================

SAMPLE:
- Total Participants: 117
- Total Observations: 468 (4 per participant)
- Age Range: ['21 - 23', '18 - 20', '24 - 26', '27 or above']
- Gender: {'Male': np.int64(68), 'Female': np.int64(48), 'Other': np.int64(1)}
- AI Familiarity: M = 4.34, SD = 1.96

MAIN FINDINGS:

1. IMAGE ORIGIN EFFECT (Correctly Labeled Only):
   Effort Rating:
   - AI Images:   M = 3.85, SD = 1.66
   - Real Images: M = 4.91, SD = 1.69
   - t(116) = -5.262, p = 0.0000, d_z = -0.486

   Sharing Intent:
   - AI Images:   M = 3.38, SD = 2.12
   - Real Images: M = 4.21, SD = 2.04
   - t(116) = -3.681, p = 0.0004, d_z = -0.340

2. ORIGIN × LABEL INTERACTION:
   See ANOVA results and interaction plots for detailed analysis.
   - Effort: Significant crossover interaction (F = 27.23, p < 0.0001)
   - Sharing: Significant crossover interaction (F = 15.63, p = 0.0001)
   - LMM: Origin × Label β = 1.932 (effort), 1.402 (sharing), both p < 0.001

3. SPECIFIC CONDITIONS:
   FP (Real→AI): Effort = 3.94, Sharing = 3.60
   FN (AI→Real): Effort = 4.80, Sharing = 4.17
   TP (AI→AI):   Effort = 3.85, Sharing = 3.38
   TN (Real→Real): Effort = 4.91, Sharing = 4.21

4. HETEROGENEITY ANALYSES:
   Gender Moderation:
   - Effort 3-way interaction: p = 0.9817
   - Sharing 3-way interaction: p = 0.5540
   - Conclusion: No significant gender moderation

   AI Familiarity Moderation:
   - Correlation with Effort Sensitivity:  r = -0.092, p = 0.3228
   - Correlation with Sharing Sensitivity: r = -0.056, p = 0.5466
   - Conclusion: No moderation effect (expertise doesn't protect against labels)

5. MODEL FIT:
   LMM Variance Explained (Marginal R²):
   - Effort: 8.3% (manipulation accounts for modest variance)
   - Sharing: 5.2% (low but expected for 7-point scales)
